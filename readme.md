Let's have a quick start.

First, you need to have ClassyDataAnalysis (https://github.com/limblab/ClassyDataAnalysis) in your MATLAB path.

Second, you need to put “xds_matlab” in your MATLAB path or cd into “xds_matlab” folder (either way).

Then, open the file “xds_matlab/example_load_single_file.m”.

Change 'params' if you need.

Specify the directory for data files.

Specify the path for saving files if you need.

Run the codes, then you will have .mat files in the path you just specified.
